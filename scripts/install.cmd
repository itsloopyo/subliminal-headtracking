:: staged into the release ZIP's shared/ by Copy-SharedBundle. To change
:: install behaviour edit the body, not this wrapper.

:: Source of truth for everything below the CONFIG BLOCK:

:: Ultimate ASI Loader: one DLL renamed to the proxy the game already
:: imports, with the mod shipped as an .asi beside the game exe. Check the
:: exe's import table before choosing ASI_LOADER_NAME - a proxy the game does
:: not import is never loaded and the mod silently does nothing.

:: Filename the ASI loader DLL is renamed to: the import the game exe already
:: has. winmm.dll, dinput8.dll, dxgi.dll and xinput1_3.dll are the common ones.
:: WINMM.dll is a static import of Subliminal-Win64-Shipping.exe.
set "ASI_LOADER_NAME=winmm.dll"
:: Subdirectory below the exe directory to deploy into, for engines that load
:: their proxy DLL from somewhere other than beside the exe. Source engine wants
:: bin\; a copy next to the exe is never loaded. Leave empty for everything
:: else, and set the same value in uninstall.cmd.
:: Empty here: games.json puts the shipping exe at Subliminal\Binaries\Win64,
:: which the body already derives, and the loader goes beside it.
set "ASI_SUBDIR="
:: Files copied only when they are not already there, so an upgrade keeps
:: whatever the user tuned. Listing an .ini in MOD_DLLS instead puts it through
:: the unconditional copy and resets every key on every update.
:: Empty: the mod writes HeadTracking.ini itself on first run, so there is no
:: default to seed.
set "MOD_SEED_FILES="
:: Version of the vendored Ultimate ASI Loader, recorded in the state file so
:: the launcher can tell which loader build it is looking at. Leave empty to
:: omit the field. Bump alongside vendor/ via `pixi run update-deps`.

:: Pin delayed expansion off before `%*` is expanded on the `call` below.

:: body already mangled. The body pins expansion off at its own outer scope
:: too, but that is one `call` too late to save the argument it was handed.
