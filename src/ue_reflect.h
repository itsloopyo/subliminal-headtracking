// Read the engine's own reflection data for a UStruct - a UFunction's parameter
// list, or a UScriptStruct's fields.
//
// Why this exists rather than a table of hardcoded struct offsets: the mod calls
// UKismetSystemLibrary::LineTraceSingle through the script VM and reads
// FHitResult::ImpactPoint out of the result. Both layouts are long, both contain
// LWC doubles whose padding moved between engine versions, and getting one field
// wrong produces an aim point that is plausible-looking garbage - the exact
// failure the reticle doctrine says costs days. The engine already stores the
// answer, keyed by name, in data this mod can read. So it asks.
//
// The only layout constants in the mod are the ones needed to read THAT data,
// and they live in the build profile's ReflectionLayout. Every one of them is
// checked before use: a UFunction whose parameter names do not resolve to
// plausible ascending offsets inside its own PropertiesSize is reported and the
// feature that needed it stands down, rather than writing into a buffer at
// offsets read out of noise.

// ResolveAll answers a different question: it proves a named field sits inside
// its own struct at the size THE ENGINE reports. That says nothing about the
// fixed-size type a caller is about to memcpy into the slot. A parameter frame
// is written into a stack buffer at these offsets, so a field the caller treats
// as a pointer or an FVector while the engine calls it something narrower puts
// the tail of that write past the end of the buffer. Ask this before every such
// write, and stand the feature down rather than perform it.
